# Random Number Facts API
![Version 1.0.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue) ![Licence](https://img.shields.io/badge/Licence-MIT-green)

This is an API which gets random number facts from the internet and makes an image of them according to my Github color scheme. It is not customizable since I feel lazy, but you have access to the source code.

You can access the API via [https://ygz-github-vercel.vercel.app/api/index](https://ygz-github-vercel.vercel.app/api/index) and use it on your Github pages if you wish. Just use the code as:
```
![Random](https://ygz-github-vercel.vercel.app/api/index)
```
and it is shown in any Github page.
